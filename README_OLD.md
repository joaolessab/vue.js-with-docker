# VCL VAST 2.0 VUE FRONTEND

### HOW PROJECT WAS CREATED
1. Installed [Vue.js CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
- ``npm install -g @vue/cli`` or ``yarn global add @vue/cli``;
2. Checked the version: ``vue --version``;
3. Created the project: ``npx @vue/cli create app``;
4. Installed the dependencies inside the project;
5. Checked the package.json to see if dependencies are aligned to what we have installed;
6. We don' want to run the project locally without docker, but if so: ``npm run serve``;

### STEPS TO RUN THE DOCKER COMPOSE
1. Certify that the Vue.js project is on the folder that you're going to run the CLI scripts;
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose;
3. Created the Dockerfile for Vue.js Enviroment as this project and point to the project folders;
4. As we do not need to download the image via docker-compose, because the Dockerfile will do it, just run to build: ``docker-compose build --no-cache``;
5. Start the service: ``docker-compose up -d``;
6. Wait until the Docker creates all the files;
7. Open the browser at: http://localhost:8080/

### STOPPING CONTAINERS
``docker-compose stop``

### RUNNING CONTAINERS BACK AGAIN
``docker-compose start``

### ACCESSING LOGS
``docker-compose logs --tail=all -f | grep vue_container``

### (WARNING): DELETING ALL CONTAINERS GENERATED BY COMPOSE
``docker-compose down --rmi all -v``

### ACCESSING TERMINAL OF THE VUE CONTAINER
1. Run: ``docker exec -it vue_container /bin/bash``
